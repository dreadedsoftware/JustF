# JustF
Because sometimes you don't have an Iterable. Sometimes you just have an F.

This is an academic endeavor to see if the operations on collections are simply Functors from some atypical Scala Category into a Container Category.

For the purposes of this exercise there are two typical Scala Categories

1. Types and Functions
    - objects are Scala Types
    - arrows are Scala Functions
2. Types and Subtypes
    - objects are Scala Types
    - arrows are subtype relationships
